# jewellery_shop_management_system
The Jewellery Shop Management System project should assist a jewellery store or a jewellery workshop to manage ordering system for their customers. The system has two user interfaces: one for the admin user (manager of the jewellery store or workshop) and the other for the client. Customers must register on the website. There they will be able to see order details and status. 
Jewellery items are grouped by categories. Each product has it's own image. A photo of each manufactured item can be attached to specific order and available for the customer to see.
Admin Features: the user can manage (add, update, delete) all the information of categories, metal type, products, orders.
